# pair-project

A responsive, mobile-friendly synthesizer that we conceived and built within a few hours as part of a pari-programming workshop 'challenge' as co-ordinated by FAC, We used Vanilla JS and CSS Grid to build the design and features, and imported the sounds using a 'Roland JUNO-106' synthezier MP3 samples bundle that we downloaded online.

The inspiration to build this came from an online drumkit we had both previously built using the Wes Bos JS30 tutorials, but the design and concept was wholly ours. We experimented with some inbuilt JS functions such as keyDown/keyPress for user-centred keyboard input response.

Have fun hitting those keys!
